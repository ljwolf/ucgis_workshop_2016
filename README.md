This workshop will cover effective methods for spatial data processing,
analysis, visualization, and documentation of results. In addition, the workshop
will cover how to use well-known Python packages for data analysis, like Pandas
& IPython/Jupyter, with PySAL. Some up-and-coming packages that make spatial
data analysis workflows easier will also be introduced. Participants will learn
how to conduct a full exploratory spatial analysis workflow in this workshop

Requirements
----------------------
We request that attendees bring their own laptop. In addition, we ask that all
attendees install the following python software packages before attending the
workshop:

- PySAL 1.11
- Pandas
- Numexpr
- SciPy
- Numpy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Seaborn

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

- Download and install Python 2.7 from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). If you are on Windows, please install the 32-bit version. 
- Open Terminal.app (Mac) or Powershell (Windows)
- At the prompt, make sure your installation is up to date by running the
  command: `conda update conda`. Press `y` if asked to confirm.
- Next, run `conda update mkl scipy numpy`.
- Once that finishes, install the dependencies required for the workshop by
  running `conda install pandas numexpr seaborn`.
- Then, run `pip install -U pysal` and confirm if asked.
- After `pysal` is installed, please run the following:
    - `pip install -U folium`
    - `pip install -U geojson`
- Finally, run `conda update jupyter`

Verifying Your Installation:
-----------------------------
At the same prompt you used to set up your terminal, type: `ipython` and hit
enter. It may take a second, but a new prompt should start. This is the ipython
& jupyter command-line interface. To make sure your environment is configured
correctly, run each of these commands at the interpreter:
- `import scipy.stats`
- `import numpy`
- `import pysal`
- `import pandas`
- `import numexpr`
- `import matplotlib`
- `import seaborn`

For windows users, if the first command fails with a message like : `DLL load
failed. The specified module could not be found`, please uninstall Anaconda and
be sure to install the 32-bit version.
